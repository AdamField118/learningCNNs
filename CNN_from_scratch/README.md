# CNN from Scratch - Building an Intuitive Understanding

## Overview

This directory contains my implementation of CNN operations built from scratch, focusing on developing deep intuitive understanding rather than computational efficiency. The goal is to understand exactly what happens so that I can make informed architectural decisions for improving ShearNet's performance.
