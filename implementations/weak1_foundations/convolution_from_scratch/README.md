# Convolution From Scratch - Building Intuitive Understanding

*Created: [Date]*  
*Part of: CNN Bootcamp Week 1 - Days 1-4*  
*Learning Objective: Understand convolution operations from first principles before using framework implementations*

## Overview

This directory contains my implementation of convolution operations built from scratch, focusing on developing deep intuitive understanding rather than computational efficiency. The goal is to understand exactly what happens during convolution so that I can make informed architectural decisions for improving ShearNet's performance.

**Key Learning Questions This Implementation Addresses:**
- How does convolution preserve spatial relationships in astronomical images?
- Why does convolution work better than fully connected layers for image data?
- How do different kernel designs affect feature extraction in galaxy images?
- What is the mathematical relationship between convolution and feature detection?

```

## Helper Functions

**Import structure:** Your main src files should import from utils like this:
```python
# In src/*.py
from utils.image_processing import add_padding, validate_convolution_inputs
from utils.visualization_tools import plot_before_after, save_analysis_figure

# In src/*.ipynb
import sys
sys.path.append('.')  # Add current directory (src) to path
from utils.image_processing import load_fits_image
from kernels.edge_detection_kernels import sobel_x_kernel
```

**Note on Python packages:** You may want to add empty `__init__.py` files to your `utils/` and `kernels/` directories to make them proper Python packages. This enables cleaner imports and better IDE support:

**Separation of concerns:** Keep the mathematical convolution logic in your main files, but delegate all the supporting tasks (file I/O, visualization, validation) to the utils.

### Benefits of This Approach

**Learning focus:** You spend your cognitive effort on understanding convolution, not wrestling with matplotlib formatting or FITS file quirks.

**Reusability:** Functions you write for edge detection can be reused for kernel experiments and performance comparisons.

**Debugging support:** Well-designed visualization helpers make it much easier to see what's happening in your convolution implementations.

**Professional development:** Learning to structure code with proper separation of concerns is valuable for your future research work.

### Phase 1: Mathematical Foundation (Day 1)
**Objective:** Understand convolution as a mathematical operation before implementing it.

**Files:**
- `src/convolution_math_derivation.py` - Implement the mathematical definition of convolution
- Understand convolution as sliding dot product
- Connect discrete convolution to continuous convolution theory
- Implement basic 1D convolution first, then extend to 2D

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- Why convolution preserves translation invariance
- How stride and padding affect output dimensions
- The relationship between convolution and correlation
- Mathematical properties: commutativity, associativity, distributivity

### Phase 2: Basic Implementation (Day 1-2)
**Objective:** Build a working 2D convolution function from scratch.

**Files:**
- `src/edge_detection_basics.py` - Core convolution implementation
- Implement nested loops approach (inefficient but clear)
- Handle edge cases: padding strategies, boundary conditions
- Add input validation and error handling

**Implementation Requirements:**
```python
def manual_convolution_2d(image, kernel, stride=1, padding=0):
    """
    Implement 2D convolution from scratch
    
    Args:
        image: 2D numpy array representing image
        kernel: 2D numpy array representing convolution kernel
        stride: Step size for convolution operation
        padding: Padding to add around image borders
    
    Returns:
        Convolved image as 2D numpy array
    """
    # Implementation details to be worked out
    pass
```

### Phase 3: Edge Detection Application (Day 2)
**Objective:** Apply convolution to actual galaxy images to see feature extraction in action.

**Files:**
- `src/galaxy_edge_detection.ipynb` - Interactive analysis notebook
- `src/kernels/edge_detection_kernels.py` - Collection of edge detection kernels

**Practical Exercises:**
1. Apply Sobel, Prewitt, and Laplacian kernels to galaxy images
2. Visualize how different kernels highlight different features
3. Compare edge detection on high-noise vs low-noise galaxy images
4. Document observations about which features are preserved/lost

**Key Insights to Document:**
- How do edges in galaxy images relate to astronomical features (spiral arms, galaxy boundaries)?
- Which kernel designs work best for different galaxy morphologies?
- How does image noise affect edge detection quality?

### Phase 4: Custom Kernel Design (Day 3)
**Objective:** Design kernels specifically for astronomical feature detection.

**Files:**
- `src/kernel_experiments.py` - Systematic testing of different kernel designs
- `src/kernels/custom_astrophysics_kernels.py` - Kernels designed for galaxy features

**Experiments to Conduct:**
1. **Scale-Sensitive Kernels:** Design kernels that detect features at galaxy-relevant scales
2. **Orientation-Sensitive Kernels:** Create kernels that respond to spiral arm patterns
3. **Brightness Gradient Kernels:** Develop kernels that detect subtle brightness variations
4. **Comparison Study:** Test custom kernels vs standard computer vision kernels

### Phase 5: Performance and Framework Comparison (Day 4)
**Objective:** Understand the relationship between manual implementation and optimized frameworks.

**Files:**
- `src/performance_comparison.py` - Compare manual vs PyTorch implementations
- Benchmark computational performance
- Verify mathematical equivalence
- Understand optimization techniques used in frameworks

## Connection to ShearNet Problem

### Relevance to Galaxy Shear Measurement
**Feature Detection Requirements:**
- Galaxy shear measurement requires detecting subtle shape distortions
- Low-noise conditions mean small systematic errors become important
- Convolution kernels must preserve shape information accurately

**Hypotheses About ShearNet Issues:**
- Could inappropriate kernel sizes be missing relevant spatial scales?
- Are edge artifacts from padding affecting precision at galaxy boundaries?
- Is the current convolution implementation introducing systematic biases?

**Questions to Investigate:**
1. What spatial scales are most important for accurate g1/g2 measurement?
2. How do different padding strategies affect measurements near galaxy edges?
3. Could custom kernels designed for galaxy morphology improve performance?

### Insights for Architecture Design
**Spatial Scale Considerations:**
- Galaxy sizes vary significantly in astronomical images
- Multi-scale approaches might be necessary for robust shear measurement
- Receptive field design should match characteristic galaxy sizes

**Precision Requirements:**
- Shear measurement requires sub-pixel precision
- Convolution implementations must avoid introducing systematic biases
- Numerical precision of convolution operations affects final accuracy
