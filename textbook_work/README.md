# Textbook Work - Building a Standardized Understanding

## Overview

This directory contains my journey through Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville, focusing on developing structured foundation of understanding. The goal is to effectively get what I'd get if I took a college course on this material!
