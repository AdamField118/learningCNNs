# ShearNet Research Bridge: From CNN Mastery to Real Research

## Overview

This directory bridges your **exceptional 6-day CNN mastery** to **real astrophysics research**. You've made original discoveries about precision-preserving architectures, modern activations, and attention mechanisms—now we apply them to improve ShearNet's galaxy shear measurement performance.
